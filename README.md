# Newfound-Courage-Minecraft

A Minecraft (Bedrock Edition) skinpack based off the game Newfound Courage.

## Installation

Hit up the [latest release](https://github.com/legowerewolf/Newfound-Courage-Minecraft/releases/latest) for the .mcpack file. Open it as you would open any file. Minecraft'll launch and import it, and then you'll find these shiny new skins in the Skins menu.

## Updates

Things are a little funky with updating the pack at the moment, so you'll have to manually delete the existing pack files.

On Windows 10, you can find the skinpack directory at
`"%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\skin_packs"`
